# React Application Boilerplate with linting support

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, an extensive list of ESLint rules and testing with `vitest`.

It is essentially an out of the box setup to start building complex applications.

The Eslint configuration presented here is just a matter of personal preference. It could be too strict sometimes(which I believe is always good in the long run). You could easily fine tune it in the `rules` section if the `.eslintre.cjs` file.
